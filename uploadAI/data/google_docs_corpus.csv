The 8-second scroll on Instagram There's a goldfish out there with better focus than GenZ. Remember when we could actually focus on a single thing for more than a hot minute? Research from @Microsoft that the attention span on platforms like Instagram has crashed down to a shocking eight seconds. This isn't just a quirky stat – it's a shift for marketers and content creators. GenZ is raised on social media and it thrives on bite-sized content. It is a game-changer for anyone trying to grab attention online. Imagine this: You craft a perfect message, only to have 90% of the viewers swipe away before they even finish the first sentence. Hurts, right? This isn't a dead end, but a challenge. How can you as a marketer create & deliver better? 1. GenZ values Authenticity above all else. If the content feels forced, GenZ is quick to discern. Brands must prioritize authentic storytelling like real-life stories, testimonials, and user-generated content that establishes a genuine connection. For eg, the popular Duolingo owl is a social media darling. Duolingo started this campaign and decided to use a quirky and relatable owl mascot to promote language learning. The mascot's humorous interactions on social media resonated with Gen Z's love of memes and lighthearted content while achieving the brand's objective. 2. Short-form video content, please. The powerhouse to capture attention is short-form video content, be it on IG reels or YouTube shorts. Whether it is showing BTS glimpses or sharing updates, this is a dynamic way to connect with GenZ effortlessly. For eg, have you ever noticed Hubspot’s instagram? HubSpot understands that B2B audiences (businesses and professionals) are bombarded with information. Their short-form video strategy focuses on delivering valuable content in a way that's informative, educational, and engaging and in shorter, more playful content formats, like behind-the-scenes glimpses at their company culture or quick marketing hacks. 3. The value of peer-to-peer recommendations. User-generated content campaigns encourage consumers to create and share content related to the brand, product, or campaign. This fosters a sense of community and belonging while amplifying brand reach. For eg, American Express - Ambassador Program American Express established an ambassador program with a network of micro-influencers who aligned with their target audience (entrepreneurs, frequent travellers). These micro-influencers then shared their experiences using Amex cards and the benefits they provided for their businesses and travel lifestyles which created more relatability and trust compared to traditional celebrity marketing. 4. Personalise the experience for your GenZ users. GenZ expects personalised experiences made for their individual preferences. Leverage data-driven insights and deliver targeted content, that feels genuine to each user on a personal level. For eg, we all love our Spotify Wrapped & Discover Weekly Spotify uses data on listening habits to curate personalised playlists like ‘Wrapped’ (yearly summary) and ‘Discover Weekly’ (new music recommendations). This taps right into GenZ’s desire for curated experiences and individuality, by getting recommendations tailored to their tastes, fostering a sense of connection. So, what are you waiting for? Let's make content that keeps the audience hooked, not hooked on the ""scroll"" button. P.S. How are YOU adapting to the ever-shrinking attention span? Share your tips and tricks in the comments below! ________________ NEWSLETTER 3 > Have we tuned out of the jingles? > Sometimes, a tune gets stuck in my head & IT. DOES. NOT. STOP. Audiences are evolving. From seeing 40-60-second ads to getting used to 15-second reels, with brands competing for our attention, jingles have become scarce. Interruptions are not welcomed. If someone finds an ad intruding and there is an option to skip, one will do so. Lets go back a bit though - what even are jingles? A jingle is basically a short, catchy, easy-to-remember song or tune used in advertising and marketing campaigns to promote a brand, product, or service. Did you know the first radio jingle came out almost a hundred years ago. A breakfast cereal commercial for a brand called Wheaties launched ‘Have You Tried Wheaties’ in 1926. - Wheaties Jingle - Have You Tried Wheaties? It was only in the 80s when jingle marketing picked up in India. An increase in radio and television sets made advertising houses focus on both marketing channels and creativity. We all know the infamous Nirma girl, right? The ‘washing powder Nirma’ (if you didn’t read this but sang this, Hi5) became one of the most famous and influential advertising jingles in that decade. All these jingles made in the 90s, from Bajaj’s ‘Humara Bajaj’ or Cadbury’s ‘kuch khaas hai hum sabhi mein’ live rent-free in our head. But have you ever wondered why? Why do I remember jingles more than I thought I ever would? Weird right, how certain music gets stuck in our heads more often than others? The science behind this is simple - earworms. Earworms are snippets of music that are pushed into your brain almost subconsciously - the ones that pop in your head for no reason. They are stored under the umbrella of involuntary memory, a component that occurs when cues encountered in everyday life trigger recollections without any conscious effort. We don’t go out of our way to jam to ‘sabki pasand nirma’ jingle over and over again - its existence confuses our neutral circuits. The right thing to ask is - why were jingles popular back then vs what happened now? Let’s try to connect the dots. > Radio was introduced in India in 1922, but it was only in the 1990s when FM broadcasting actually became an every Indian household thing. That’s also when the Indian economy was booming, which led to a push for TVs to become more common. > There was a mix of creativity and usage of proper marketing channels during this time. The internet era boomed, liberalisation took place and advertising jingles and slogans became the norm. Everyone eagerly watched the ads too, unlike today. > Television evolved from radio and in radio, jingles were obviously more important than visuals. Few years and some great ad jingles later, TV ad industry moved away from its radio roots, and jingles became less important than visuals. > Soon enough, special effects and CGI (computer-generated imagery) happened. The modern audience is more attracted to ads that look good. So, the ad industry has been focusing more on making their ads visually impressive first. Moreover, buying music rights of popular songs viewers already listen to is easier. No jingle writer to be hired, no song to be written, no music rights to take care of, no special instruments or a team to hire — the visuals are edited together with the sound and the rest takes care of itself. Sounds a little less hectic, doesn’t it? Fast forward to 2024, and in the reel era, jingles are close to non-existent. Packing the idea, adding a surprise and making it iconic enough to make an impact is challenging. The formula to make a jingle? Probably not that easy. And it is definitely not rhyming two words. The two important things to keep in mind are: melody composition and brand message integration. Your melody must be catchy, memorable and reflects your brand’s personality. It should evoke emotions in the listener, feeling somewhat attached to the brand. It is essential to strike a balance between advertising effectiveness to convey selling points while maintaining musicality and quality. While doing our research, we found an AI tool to create a jingle. It was fun tbh. You should give it a shot too: https://www.aijinglemaker.com/ The impact of jingles on consumer behaviour Songs and jingles evoke emotions, create brand recognition, and establish an emotional connection between consumers and brands, influencing consumer behaviour and decision-making. The repetitive nature of jingles reinforces brand messaging, making it memorable and creating familiarity with the product, which leads to increased trust and a sense of community among consumers. According to a report, an electroencephalogram (EEG), a test that measures brain activity by recording the electrical signals produced by the brain took place. The average purchase intention of the group who heard music was 4.36, while the group without music averaged 3.64. The people BTS of creating our favourite jingles 1. Kailash Surendranath: Created the jingle for Nirma's washing powder ad 2. Vanraj Bhatia: Composed music for the legendary Cadbury and Humara Bajaj ads. 3. AR Rahman: Wrote for Hum Mein Hai Hero - Hero MotoCorp TV Commercial Ad Arguably the most significant growth phase came in the 90s. Advertising jingles and slogans became the norm. How is the industry looking for jingle writers in today’s time? While jingle writing was once a thriving industry, it's significantly declined in recent years. The rise of digital advertising, streaming services, and shorter attention spans has made traditional jingles not so relevant anymore. From jingles to singles, marketing trends have changed from recording original ad tunes to using popular music as a background for ads today. With chart-toppers already in the hearts and minds of consumers, it is an easier and faster way to create impressions. That without the hassle of rhyming scripts and composing tunes. Thus came the end of the jingle era that we were ever so fond of. Do we love the jingles that were once made and still sing them in our heads? Yes. Do we think jingles won’t work anymore? Probably yes too. Our reel-ready brain isn’t up for it yet. ________________ (DO NOT USE) Old version Brands today avoid experimenting with jingles, despite helping with brand recall and evoking nostalgia within the audience. Jingles have been a powerful part of advertising for decades. Be it emotional connection, memorability, brand identity reinforcement or nostalgia that feels like a warm fuzzy feeling when we think about ‘good old days’, jingles had a lasting impact on the minds of consumers. > What was the reason for kindle marketing to be popular back then > How does it impact consumers > Who are legendary jingle creators? > Was it an actual job/thing people did? > Formula to correct jingle making Has social media killed advertising jingles? There was a time in the Indian Advertisement Industry when every ad had a small, catchy jingle associated with it and more often than not, these jingles were able to grab the consumer’s attention. Who can forget the “Do Minute Ruk Sakte Hain……” ad for Maggi Noodles or the “Kuch Khass hai Zindagi mein…….” for Cadbury’s or the “Yeh dil maange more” commercial for Pepsi. (nirma ad image) (coca cola ad image) (humara bajaj ad image) https://youtu.be/CbNTcvzrpBY https://youtu.be/opnYzUidXXM?feature=shared The use of jingles in the ads has considerably declined. The actual challenge for both the ad-maker and the brand is to ensure that their ad has the same impact even when it is played years after it was aired for the first time. A typical example here are the ads which the Nirma Group came up with, a decade or two ago. The challenge for advertising is to deliver the brand message in merely a few seconds, especially online. To market music in the age of 15 seconds and reels is a tough task. To pack the idea, add a surprise and make it iconic enough to make an impact sounds a bit disruptive, especially with reducing attention spans. Audiences are evolving. Interruptions are not welcomed. If someone finds an ad intruding and there is an option to skip, one will do so. The challenge for advertising is to deliver the brand message in merely a few seconds, especially online. What’s the deal with mascots though? From Ronald McDonald to Amul Girl or Vodafone ZooZoos, mascots have been an integral part of elevating and differentiating brands while creating strong connections. But with the fast-paced digital world and varied audience, brand mascots have lost their mojo. ​​Even though brand mascots might be as stuck in the past as you might think. They’ve evolved, adapted, and even thrived in the digital age, but they’re just not necessarily taking centre stage anymore. One brand doing this is HyFun Foods, a frozen food manufacturer from India, which has recently created a brand mascot called Funzy. The mascots help differentiate the brand in a crowded category and build relevance with Gen Z and Gen Alpha who value authenticity. With the rise of social media platforms, it provides a unique opportunity for mascots to engage with audiences better. Songs evoke emotions, create brand recognition and establish an emotional connection between consumers and brands, which influences consumer behaviour and decision making. Jingles are supposed to be repetitive, which helps reinforce brand messaging and make it memorable. This creates familiarity with the product, which can lead to increased trust in the brand. Jingles also have the power to create a sense of community amongst consumers with similar interests. ________________ REFERENCES/RESOURCES Case Study: The Walt Disney Company revives classic animated movies like 'The Lion King' and 'Beauty and the Beast' periodically, rekindling fond memories for both new and longtime fans. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hayleyevans1_a-collection-of-cadbury-out-of-home-ads-which-activity-7165994199572541440-vFY_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jimmy-shahani-69922825_strategy-branding-advertising-activity-7168473176870522880-12Mf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop ⏩ It's about tapping into shared cultural experiences and collective memories. ⏩ Who can forget the iconic ""𝐇𝐮𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐚 𝐁𝐚𝐣𝐚𝐣"" campaign by Bajaj, which celebrated the brand's legacy and the memories associated with their iconic scooters? ⏩ Or the heartwarming ""𝐃𝐚𝐚𝐠 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐡𝐞 𝐇𝐚𝐢𝐧"" 𝐚𝐝 𝐛𝐲 𝐒𝐮𝐫𝐟 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐥, which celebrated the innocence of childhood and the memories of playing carefree in the mud? https://www.socialsamosa.com/2021/08/brand-saga-paperboat-advertising-journey-recap/ Nostalgia is everywhere in marketing, but times—and audiences—are changing.

It’s difficult to see your customers leave. The ones you put effort in, built a relationship with, the ones you built the next big thing with…and just like that, they leave, without any warning. There’s no way around these breakups. You didn’t think that once you find a client they stay with you forever, did you? Even the most loyal customers may part ways with your agency, for a number of reasons. And then all that’s left to think about is - “How do you cope with losing a client?” The big question is - what makes a client leave? Sure, it is not necessarily your fault when it happens. Clients come and go. The Martin Agency lost Walmart to Publicis Groupe after half a decade of working together. Big agencies have a well-earned reputation and high credibility – some of their clients still decide to part ways with them. So, if it happens to you, it does not mean that you did something wrong. Your clients may have had their own reasons. Consider the client’s perspective before going into the self-analysis (or self-doubt) mode - budget constraints, better services elsewhere, management changes, and in-house teams. All these are fair reasons for a client to leave. But also, could it be your mistake? That’s the real question you need to ask yourself when you lose a client. Unclarified expectations, missing deadlines, flawed communication, no clear point of contact, and overcomplication - if these things happened, you probably messed up too. If you lose a customer because you failed them or because of miscommunication, they are likely to spread the word. The agency-client network isn’t that big. 95% of unsatisfied customers share their negative opinions with others. 45% do it on social media, where 63% of consumers read their reviews and draw conclusions. You don’t want that. - Source The bigger question is HOW to get an old client back. Even if your best client is gone, it doesn’t mean you cannot win them back. Here is a real-life example: A global shipping and logistic company, UPS (United Parcel Service) lost thousands of workers and clients in 1997, the company was on the brink of bankruptcy. In 1998, they increased their profits by 87% and returned stronger than ever. They called their clients, offered discounts, apologized, and reassured everyone that they got it. Humans understand humans, they were confident and cheerful this time. And guess what? It worked. A few tips on how to get your client back: * Don’t rush: Your client had a reason to leave, and trying to get them right back will make things worse. Give it time, they might want to return later especially if you had a great client-agency relationship. Discover other avenues like inviting for events, offering pro-bono advice, periodic check-ins etc to stay within the client’s view instead of trying to get them back full-time. Also pro-tip: Learn why they stopped buying your services - For example, having a client feedback form to understand their pain points can help you have a better client-agency relationship in the future. * Make a new offer: Be patient. Take the time to make a unique offer that aligns with your former client’s current needs. During your time working together, they learned what to expect from you. A fresh offer could pleasantly surprise them and make them reconsider giving you another chance. * Know about their business situation: When a client moves on, it might be due to a shift in their business model. To win them back, you need to understand their current needs. Treat them, in part, as if they were a brand-new client, approaching the situation with a fresh mindset. * Most importantly, learn to move on: Sometimes after putting it your all, things do not work out. And that’s okay too. Just ensure you don't repeat the same mistakes with your new customers. Winning back ex-clients is all about showing them how you’ve grown and why partnering with you again is a smart move. With the right strategy, you might just turn those past clients into your most loyal advocates once more. ________________ PS - At Upload, we’ve curated resource kits that can help you have a better client-agency relationship.

NEWSLETTER 6 Is “vibe marketing” just a fancy excuse to let AI do your job? Maybe. But also… maybe not. AI is everywhere - ChatGPT is fueling Ghibli trends, Spotify’s AI curated list, and even Gemini AI is in our cars! And now, it's in the entire marketing world. Enter ‘vibe marketing’- a term originating from the term ‘vibe coding’ by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, “where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists”. In marketing, it’s using AI to handle almost all the work, while you check if the work is done right. So what really is ‘vibe marketing’? Picture a traditional marketing firm. Content writers. Designers. Technology team members. All of them take too much time. As per Inc42’s data, the top 28 Indian fintech startups spent INR 5,495.16 Crores in the financial year 2021-22 on marketing activities. (Source: https://inc42.com/features/top-28-indian-fintech-spent-672-mn-advertising-marketing-fy22/#:~:text=According%20to%20Inc42's%20data%2C%20the,promotions%20and%20other%20marketing%20activities. That’s a LOT of money. Vibe marketing is the AI-assisted evolution of how brands are being built — faster, cheaper, and a lot less manually. Think of it like replacing your 15-step approval workflow with one strong prompt and a decent eye for edits. Ideation? Prompt it with ChatGPT. Copy? Generate it with ChatGPT or Claude. Design? AI-generated visuals using ChatGPT, Gemini, and even Kling AI. Campaign execution? Zapier says hi. Analytics? tl;dv’s got the notes, Google Analytics got the data. You’re still in the driver’s seat, but AI is now possibly your backseat strategist. So, how do you get into ‘vibe marketing’? 1. Start small. Use ChatGPT to come up with ideas for your next campaign. Tweak it until you get it right. @Microsoft used AI tools to generate early-stage campaign ideas for the Surface pro and Surface laptop hardware, including scripting and storyboarding. They started by letting AI set the foundation before layering on human refinement. 2. The goal isn’t to replace you. Use your judgment and review AI’s output. Microsoft didn’t just run with raw AI output. The team heavily edited and fine-tuned the AI-generated visuals to fix inaccuracies and maintain production quality. 3. Prompting AI is an art, and your new job. Practice, practice, practice till you get it right. To generate usable storyboards and visuals, Microsoft needed to write precise, strategic prompts to guide AI tools effectively, proving that prompting is becoming a creative skill in itself. 4. Run a campaign using AI from start to finish and analyze results. Rinse and repeat. The Microsoft ad was a real-world test: AI was used end-to-end across scripting, visuals, and ideation. The outcome? Cost and time savings, without any audience realising AI was involved. You can read more about how Microsoft generated the ad here: https://microsoft.design/articles/we-made-an-ad-with-generative-ai/ How to run a campaign using AI you asked? Here’s your guide. Pick a low-risk campaign — maybe a newsletter, a carousel post, or a product launch teaser. Use AI tools at every step: * Use ChatGPT or Gemini for ideation and copy drafts. * Use Midjourney or Adobe Firefly for visual explorations. * Use Notion AI or Motion for project planning. * Automate posting and follow-ups with Zapier or Buffer. Once the campaign is live, measure performance like you usually would: clicks, conversions, saves, comments, whatever fits the objective. What part did AI help speed up? Where did it fall short? Document it. Learn. Iterate. AI doesn’t replace strategy — it speeds up the loop. The tighter your loop, the better your results. So what’s the actual truth? Are marketers being replaced by AI? Not exactly. Vibe marketing is not just a buzzword, it’s the new marketing approach. The marketers who thrive won't be the ones saying, “This is how we've always done it."" They'll be the ones who work along with AI, not against it. The brands that figure out how to blend human instinct with machine intelligence? They’ll win. The ones who think “vibes” are enough without a strategy? Not so much. PS - At Upload, we’re not just talking about vibe marketing — we’re applying it every day. For Rescript, we used AI to identify long-tail keywords, adopt a more conversational tone, and highlight stat-based insights in their blogs. The result? Better rankings on Google’s Gemini AI-powered search. From idea to execution, we’re learning how to make AI work for strategy, not just speed. Curious how that plays out in real time? We’re always experimenting: uploaddigital.co NEWSLETTER 7 Breaking the funnel: Gen Z’s take on marketing 2.0 Exploring how Gen Z is reshaping consumer engagement and why marketers need to take notes. ________________ Why is everyone talking about Gen Z marketing? Gen Z, born between 1997 and 2012, is no ordinary consumer group and is reshaping consumer behaviour. With 40% of the global consumer market in their hands, they are not just buyers—they’re cultural tastemakers. Their choices and behaviours set the tone for industries, redefine marketing strategies, and influence everything from fashion and technology to social causes and lifestyle norms. They’re not loyal to traditional marketing strategies or loyalty programs. Instead of being drawn into marketing funnels, Gen Z engages through experiences, community-driven interactions, and social validation. (Source) * 80% look to social media for inspiration * Over 50% demand brand authenticity before engaging * Gen Z influences purchasing decisions across all generations (Check the survey here) Ignoring this demographic is like ignoring the future of marketing itself. The old rules of marketing? Mid. If you want to keep up, it’s time to adapt. ________________ The Gen Z marketing basic toolkit 1. Anything that feels fake is instantly rejected. 2. They don’t just want to be sold to—they want to be part of the conversation. 3. Silence on societal issues isn’t an option; 58% assume brands doing so are complicit. ________________ Meet the Slang: A cheat sheet for marketers Language is culture, and for Gen Z, slang is a way to connect and exclude. Some good-to-know terms: * Rizz: Charm or appeal. (“Your campaign has rizz.”) * No Cap: Not lying. (“That deal is amazing, no cap!”) * Slay: Impress or succeed. (“Your content slays.”) * Mid: Average or unimpressive. (Avoid being called this at all costs.) Use these sparingly, though. Slang can enhance relatability, but inauthentic usage will cause cringe. ________________ The Gen Z effect: Stories of brands that got it right"" Case Study 1: Duolingo’s Instagram Takeover - https://www.instagram.com/duolingo/ Duolingo’s witty, unhinged strategy gained them over 3.3 million followers. Their mascot became a pop culture icon by hopping on trends, creating relatable skits, and not being afraid to poke fun at themselves. Takeaway: Experimentation and humor build relatability. Don't shy away from imperfection. Case Study 2: Nykaa’s Community-First Approach Nykaa has captured Gen Z’s attention with inclusivity-driven campaigns featuring diverse models and influencers. By prioritizing authenticity through real reviews and leveraging influencer partnerships, the brand builds trust and seamlessly engages in Gen Z’s cultural conversations. Takeaway: For Gen Z, authenticity, diversity, and inclusivity are essential. Brands must reflect these values in their messaging and actions. Case Study 3: Ryanair’s No-Holds-Barred Instagram Ryanair has redefined airline marketing with its irreverent, meme-centric approach on Instagram. From poking fun at competitors to creating viral reels featuring Gen Z slang, their unapologetic humorous content resonates with young audiences. By leaning into humour and relatability, they’ve created an online persona that makes the brand unforgettable. Takeaway: Don’t be afraid to embrace humor, even in unconventional or “boring” industries. Being bold and authentic creates strong connections with Gen Z. ________________ The all-new Gen Z marketing funnel Gen Z doesn’t follow the traditional funnel of awareness → consideration → purchase → loyalty. Instead, their journey is dynamic and nonlinear: Inspiration → Exploration → Community → Loyalty * They seek inspiration//shop on platforms like Instagram and TikTok. * Validation from peers in comments or reviews holds more weight than ads. * Loyalty is driven by values and a sense of community, not programs. - how important you make them feel The new marketing playbook: 1. Create interactive and dynamic touchpoints. 2. Leverage user-generated content to build trust. 3. Focus on experiences rather than direct sales. ________________ The million-dollar question: Do you really need to go full Gen Z? * Yes, if your target audience includes this demographic, you’ll need to evolve your messaging. * No, if it means sacrificing authenticity or alienating your core audience. Remember, the goal is to adapt while staying true to your brand’s identity. Gen Z appreciates brands that are unapologetically themselves—as long as they’re relatable. Actionable tips for marketers 1. Go where Gen Z is - * Instagram: Visually engaging feed with reels, memes, and authentic stories * Discord: For exclusive communities to make genuine connections and two-way communication * Reddit: Engage in niche subreddits with authentic participation and value-driven content 2. Build two-way conversations; don’t just push content. 3. Showcase your brand’s values authentically. 4. Be creative and don’t fear unconventional strategies. ________________ Final thoughts: The future is Gen-Z Marketing to Gen Z isn’t about mastering trends—it’s about creating meaningful, authentic connections. Brands like Duolingo, Nykaa, and Fenty have shown that when done right, Gen Z marketing doesn’t just sell products; it builds movements. So, marketers: What’s your move? Let’s hear your thoughts—no cap. NEWSLETTER 8 “Let’s get a Gen Z intern” — and other marketing myths that need to go If I had a rupee for every time I heard “We need to target Gen Z,” I’d probably have enough to launch a slang-filled, chaos-coded Instagram, reel campaign… that Gen Z would scroll past in under 2 seconds. Let’s be honest: Most “Gen Z strategies” aren’t strategies. They’re stereotypes dressed up in a Google Slides. Stop panic-dressing your brand in what you think Gen Z wants, and hoping it works. Here is all that you need to know instead. It’s not just where Gen Z is — it’s why they’re there Gen Z isn’t a vibe. Or a dance. Or a 3-second attention span on TikTok. They’re not one-size-fits-all — they’re layered, curious, and everywhere at once. Here’s the real breakdown: * Reddit for curiosity * YouTube for long-form deep dives * Discord for real conversations * Instagram for nostalgia * TikTok for rabbit holes and randomness It’s not about where they are. It’s about what they’re doing there — and why. ________________ The real Gen Z brief that (some) brands give Most briefs go like this: “Let’s be funny like Duolingo.” “Let’s do a dance trend.” “Let’s throw in some Gen Z slang.” “Let’s ask the intern what’s trending.” Reality check: That’s not a strategy. That’s trying to sound cool instead of being clear. Gen Z doesn’t reward brands for showing up. They reward brands for having a purpose, saying something real, and knowing what the hell they’re doing on the platform. ________________ So, what does good Gen Z marketing actually look like? * It’s native to the platform: Don’t just post content, fit into the context. Learn the culture before you join the conversation. * It’s trend-aware, but not trend-obsessed: Trends matter. Gen Z speaks fluent TikTok/Instagram reels - but they also know when you’re just riding the wave without saying anything new. * It speaks with them, not at them: You don’t need to mimic Gen Z, just respect their intelligence. Talk like a human, not a “brand voice.” * It respects their time: They have endless scroll options. You’ve got two seconds to be worth it. It’s rooted in value: They don’t need you to be trendy — they need you to stand for something. ________________ Ask better questions: Instead of asking: “How do we go viral?” Ask: * What part of this is actually relevant to them? * Are we adding to the conversation, or just echoing trends? * Does this sound like us or like we’re borrowing someone else’s voice? ________________ It’s not about Gen Z. It’s about better marketing. Boomers share Reels. Millennials double-tap. Gen Z shares in DMs. Different platforms, same emotion: “This made me think of you.” Great marketing connects. It doesn’t chase. So the next time someone says: “We want Gen Z on TikTok!” Ask: Are we saying something worth listening to? Or just wearing the Gen Z outfit and hoping for the best? NEWSLETTER 9 Stop calling yourself a community-first brand (if you're just broadcasting to followers) Every brand loves to say: “We’re building a community.” But when you think more, you’ll mostly find content going one way—outward. Let’s be honest. What many brands call “community” is just a well-dressed follower count. No conversations. No rituals. No true connection. They’re not building communities. They’re building audiences and mistaking engagement for belonging. Community ≠ Followers * A community talks to each other. * A follower base listens to you talk. If your engagement strategy is just Stories, Reels, and the occasional “comment your thoughts below”, it is time to think more. Brands that got it right * Figma built an actual product community. Their forums, design challenges, and community plugins make users feel like contributors, not consumers. * CRED launched the CRED Curious community, which initially began as a podcast and has since evolved into a community with gated content and event invites. * Lululemon didn’t build a “customer base.” They built a lifestyle tribe. Ambassadors, in-person events, and sweat-life content offline and online. ________________ What real community looks like * Members ask each other questions, not brands asking for engagement * UGC is organic & consistent, not a contest that no one joins * People identify with each other, not just scroll, watch and forget * There’s a shared culture within the community, not a fixed content calendar You need shared language, rituals, and inside jokes. Your brand needs to get out of the spotlight sometimes and make your people the main character. ________________ Want to actually build a community? Let’s simplify it. If you’re serious about building a real community, not just calling it one, start here: 1. Start small, with intention. Don’t scale before you connect. The strongest communities begin with fewer people who shape the tone, energy, and culture. Let them lead the vibe. 2. Give more than you take. Communities run on trust, not transactions. Share value—resources, support, recognition—without asking for clicks or conversions. 3. Choose the right platform—and commit to it. Not every space is made for your kind of community. Pick one that fits the format you want (Telegram ≠ Discord ≠ Instagram). Then show up consistently. Don’t launch and leave. 4. Stop hoarding the mic. Real community = shared space. Let your members speak, host, share, and build. That’s when it starts to scale organically. ________________ TLDR * Choose platforms strategically, not out of fear. * Community isn’t a vanity metric—it’s a deeper connection. * Brand building is about depth, not breadth. ________________ NEWSLETTER 10 Let’s be honest: no one’s reading your 7-slide carousel about your “disruptive MVP.” It’s 2025. We’re scrolling fast. We’re overstimulated. And we want instant dopamine. Not just for laughs anymore, today, memes are a form of online social currency. But why do memes work so well? Because attention spans are shorter than ever. We don’t read; we skim. Memes, when done right, pack brand voice, audience insight, and relatability into one quick scroll-stopper. But they don’t work for everyone. Memes thrive in brands that lean into humour, personality, and cultural relevance like food, fashion, entertainment, D2C, and creator-first spaces. If your brand tone is playful, bold, or community-driven, memes can supercharge your connection with your audience. Let’s be real - no one’s stopping to read your 7-slide carousel about your “game-changing product.” It’s 2025. Everyone’s scrolling fast. Attention spans are short. We don’t really read content anymore. We skim. We swipe. We move on. Memes are quick, fun, and easy to understand. But more importantly - they make people feel something instantly. And when that happens, people remember your brand. That said, this doesn’t work for everyone. Memes and reels work best for: * Consumer-first brands (skincare, D2C, tech, lifestyle) * Startups trying to build community and virality * Companies with a clear cultural POV or niche If you’re a legacy B2B brand? You’ll need a different kind of strategy. Should every brand do meme marketing? We hope not. * If your audience expects seriousness, like in healthcare, finance, or law, a light or snarky meme may feel tone-deaf and erode trust. * The same meme approach may feel native on Instagram or TikTok but fall flat on LinkedIn or corporate email lists. * Younger audiences may expect bold, witty content that breaks the rules, feels real; older audiences or professional users expect polished, respectful communication. Let’s take three examples: Swiggy Instamart: Their brand thrives on chaotic humor, pop culture, and Gen-Z energy. A meme about late-night cravings? Perfect. Crumble Pakistan A dessert brand that understands internet culture like a pro. They’ve mastered the art of meme-first marketing: combining relatable humor and trending formats that make people laugh and crave their product. PharmEasy: Their brand deals with health, medicine, and trust. A meme-heavy approach would feel off. When you're selling life-critical meds, a joke can go wrong—even if it’s clever. Meme marketing is not just slapping your product into a trending template. * Be part of culture, not above it. Memes work when they speak the language of your audience. Not when they feel overly branded or forced. * Build a meme voice, not just a one-off viral post. If people start recognizing your meme tone week after week, that’s when you own mindshare. * Know when not to meme. Don’t force it if: * It clashes with your brand tone * Your audience won’t get the reference * You’re copying a trend without context * You see memes as a shortcut, not a brand strategy So when should you not do meme marketing? Don’t do it if: * It doesn’t align with your brand tone * It doesn’t speak to your target audience * You’re copying trends without understanding the context * You see it as a shortcut instead of a long-term brand play Meme marketing works when your audience expects it, relates to it, and shares it. If none of that applies? It’s okay to sit it out. But here’s the thing it’s not for everyone. And it’s definitely not “just for fun.” Meme marketing isn’t “just for fun.” It’s fast-moving, sticky brand communication — when done right. It opens doors, sparks conversations, and sometimes, it's the reason someone becomes a customer in the first place. LANDING PAGE Oh hey! 👋 I'm Ginni, your friendly neighborhood bot at Upload Digital.
